<h5>A new approach to online learning </h5>
<p>Oppia is a free and open-source online learning platform for collaboratively creating and sharing interactive lessons. Oppia’s lesson builder allows educators to provide students with targeted, personalized feedback that simulates conversation with an intelligent, virtual tutor. </p>

<h5>Impacting students around the world</h5>
<p>Oppia was built to meet the unique needs of the developing world, where educational resources are scarce and methodologies are outdated. Our storytelling-based approach to learning requires less bandwidth than educational videos, making it accessible in areas with limited internet connections. Adaptive lessons with personalized feedback create a safe, interactive learning environment otherwise unavailable to underserved communities.
By uniting a global community of volunteers and educators, Oppia’s lessons are continually translated into new languages and adapted for different cultures.</p>
