                            <p class="lead text-muted">Oppia was built to meet the unique needs of the developing world, where educational resources are scarce and methodologies are outdated.

Our storytelling-based approach to learning requires less bandwidth than educational videos, making it accessible in areas with limited internet connections. Adaptive lessons with personalized feedback create a safe, interactive learning environment otherwise unavailable to underserved communities.

By uniting a global community of volunteers and educators, Oppia’s lessons are continually translated into new languages and adapted for different cultures.  </p>
