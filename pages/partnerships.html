  <h2>We’re looking for partners</h2>
  <h4>The Oppia Foundation has already helped over 800,000 learners. Help us bring engaging, effective lessons to students around the world.</h4>

  <h3>Empowering students in every community</h3>
  <p>
    Overcrowded classrooms, scarce materials, outdated teaching methods and excessive punishments prevent students in underserved communities from acquiring the knowledge they need to be successful later in life. It’s a problem that isn’t limited to developing countries. In the United States, low-income and rural students consistently show major achievement gaps compared to their more affluent peers. The Oppia Foundation believes a digital classroom that provides access to interactive, engaging lessons is the key to closing these gaps in educational outcomes.
  </p>

  <h3>Our approach</h3>
  <p>
    The goal of our foundation is to give students of all backgrounds a chance to learn the skills they need to build brighter futures for themselves and their communities. We are a building a global community of educators to build a library of lessons that gives anyone an opportunity to learn about what interests them. By allowing educators to create lessons that provide personalized feedback, we aim to give students from every walk of life the one-on-one support of a private tutor. We are also currently working on incorporating machine learning to make feedback even more personal and dynamic.
  </p>

  <h3>Evidence of our success</h3>
  <p>
    Together with EvalDesign, we conducted a randomized controlled trial of our learning platform with students in Dehli, India and found improvements in concept mastery as great as 79% compared to controls. User studies have shown that students throughout the world find Oppia lessons enjoyable and impactful.

  <h3>We’re ready to grow!</h3>

    Building a dynamic, global community to transform online learning is a bold vision that requires generous support. 
    That’s why your help is so important.
